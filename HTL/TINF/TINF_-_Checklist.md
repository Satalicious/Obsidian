Summary from 2. Semester:
mbed = Hardware + C + reading/ understanding libraries (header files) & prototypes
**Hardware interrupts (still not completed)**
- [ ] Ticker class
- [ ] DigitalIn
- [ ] InterruptIn

**Output**
- [ ] DigitalOut (control over single output at a time)
- [ ] BusOut (control over a number of outputs at a time - control over the behaviour of individual elements is not possible)

**C/ C++:**
*Focus on these:*
- [ ] bitwise operation (blinky with BusOut - simulator - leave until later)
- [ ] pointers
- [ ] loop (while, especially while loop in main())
- [ ] strings

**mbed libraries**
- [ ] Callback function
- [ ] function parameters (what should go into each function)
- [ ] Return value of each function (very important if some arithmetic operations are required!!!)
